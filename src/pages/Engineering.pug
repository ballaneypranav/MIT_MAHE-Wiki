        # Introduction
        While we are at finding a therapeutic solution for methylmercury poisoning, to avoid coming up with more problems, for the safety of the team and the environment we have considered all the precautions and safety measures to be taken to make our work environment safe, ensure proper disposal of waste materials and to prevent and hazardous situations.

        # Lab Conditions
        Our entire project requires a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) laboratory. This is because our project only deals with Biosafety level 1 bacteria (Escherichia coli DH5alpha and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917) and therefore we consider our project to be harmless to researchers in this aspect. None of our experiments increase the pathogenicity of the bacteria.
        
        To maintain aseptic conditions, we perform all experiments inside the laminar flow chamber while ensuring the UV light doesn’t cause any problems to the person performing the experiment.

        We take precautions while working with the autoclave and handle hot autoclaved equipment with appropriate gloves and to maintain aseptic conditions to prevent contamination by unwanted DNA. Gloves are used not only for handling hot equipment and chemicals but also for cold samples taken out of the freezer to avoid cold burns. Special precautions are followed for making use of equipment for gel electrophoresis, sonication and gas chromatography.

        We have our labs equipped with an emergency shower, eyewash station, and a first aid kit. We make it a point to clean up our workstation and dispose of all waste materials properly.

        # Handling Reagents
        All forms of mercury, both organic and inorganic are highly toxic. Animal models indicate that ingestion of fewer than 5 grams may be fatal or may cause serious damage to the health of the individual. To avoid mercury poisoning by accidental inhalation, ingestion, injection or absorption through the skin while working with it we make sure we use the appropriate type of gloves and other essential lab attire. We keep mercury spill kits handy in the lab in case of an emergency. All mercury containing waste is disposed of separately packed in a container with a hazardous waste label on it with the chemical name. We have taken into consideration all the hazardous waste disposal laws in India and have also enlisted the ones in the US for reference in our safety manual.

        # GMO Safety
        Biosafety being of at most importance while working with a Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), considerations have been made for preventing the uncontrolled release of the genetically modified organism into the environment. _Escherichia coli_ Nissle 1917 is responsible for producing fitness factors called ‘colicins’ that are toxic to other _Escherichia coli_ strains. In our case, it would be an advantage as we want our bacteria to compete while it stays in the gut. Furthermore, its ability to form biofilms increases its long-term persistence in the gut.
        
        # Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
        Our safety handbook outlines the MSDS - as per US and Indian regulations for the following reagents and chemicals.
