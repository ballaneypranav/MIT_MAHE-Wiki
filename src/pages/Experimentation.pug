        # Introduction
        Validation and testing of all aspects of a design can be done through experimentation. We have brainstormed several experiments after thorough research and questioning, keeping in mind all the risks that could be involved but due to lack of access to laboratory facilities, we are yet to actually perform and troubleshoot them. 

        We have divided our experiments into three types: **Chassis**, **Composite BioBrick 1** and **Composite BioBrick 2** experiments. These experiments should enable us to test the efficiency, relevance and safety aspects of each gene and the overall project. 

        Experiments to find the threshold concentration of methylmercury required by the transformed bacteria to generate a response and a test to analyse the tolerance of the bacteria to high levels of methylmercury chloride, pH and paraquat (oxidative stress) have been designed as part of the chassis and preliminary experiments. Further experiments have been broken down to the study of the two biobricks we have designed. Characterization of the different parts of the plasmids, determination of the most efficient combination of parts, Understanding the amount of stress required to activate the parts, showing the efficiency of the system and recognition of the compatibility and working of the two plasmids are some the several aspects and considerations we have looked into. All of the experiments were designed without disregarding any safety concerns and keeping in mind good lab practices. To replicate the gut environment the experiments should be performed at a **pH of 6-7** and **37° celsius** and circuits assembled using Gibson assembly. All the measurement equipment used should be **calibrated** before each experiment.

        Even though the methylmercury concentration that harms humans differs in different individuals, for experimental purposes we have referred to literature and chosen concentrations with **known physiological effects** on mice and humans [Ashner M., 2012](#citation1).  

        # Chassis
        
        We have decided on _Escherichia Coli_ Nissle 1917 as our chassis. It is a known probiotic non-pathogenic strain. We have designed experiments to show that the strain used for the probiotic to be made, _Escherichia coli_ Nissle 1917 can survive under **oxidative stress**, **varying pH** and is **safe** [iGEM Uppsala, 2013](#citation2) [iGEM Tuebingen, 2019](#citation3).

        ### Preliminary Experiments
        _Escherichia coli_ DH5α inoculated with Composite Bio-Brick 1 should be induced with methylmercuric chloride and the fluorescence of the GFP must be measured on a spectrofluorometer (excitation - 350nm, emission - 500nm wavelength) post calibration. Measurement of O.D and GFP intensity should be done at intervals of 60 minutes for 4.5 hours post which minimum and maximum accumulation of mercury inside the cell must be estimated using Gas Chromatography _(Detailed protocol given in handbook)_. In this preliminary experiment one would obtain the **threshold** response - which can be used as the **minimum** limit, and the limit of **tolerance** of the bacteria - to be used as the **maximum limit** for other experiments.

        ### Control Mechanism

        We test the response of MerR to methylmercury using 2 control circuits which do not have the MerR gene present in them. E. coli cells inoculated with methylmercury chloride are grown for the required amount of time according to the results of the preliminary experiment. We check for GFP intensities expecting an exponential increase in fluorescence with an increase in methylmercury concentration for the circuit with MerR present. For the control with PmerT, transcription is initiated but at a lower level than the circuit to be tested. The plot of fluorescence and methylmercury concentration indicates that MerR contributes significantly in methylmercury response.

        # Characterizing the transport system of Bio-Brick 1
        To determine the final transport design, we test three circuits consisting of a combination of genes among MerP, MerC, MerT and MerE. Through literature survey we found out three circuit designs are possible. The circuit showing the most effective results and can most efficiently reduce metabolic burden will be chosen as the bio-brick for the transport system for our first plasmid.
        Circuits we test for the final transport design system:
        1. MerP-MerT-MerC-MerE
        2. MerC-MerE
        3. MerP-MerT -MerE
        
        To test the efficiency and characterize each of the 4 parts separately we carry out experiments with each of the parts making use of 2 test circuits and 2 controls.
        
        Circuits:
        1. The final transport design system
        2. Constitutive Promoter- RBS – (The part to be tested, i.e. MerP, MerC, MerT or MerE) -RBS-Double Terminator
        
        Controls:
        1. Final circuit design without the part to be tested
        2. Wild type Escherichia coli DH5alpha
        
        E. coli cells inoculated with methylmercury chloride are grown for the required amount of time according to the results of the preliminary experiment respectively for the 2 circuits to be tested and 2 controls. The cell suspension is centrifuged and the mercury concentration in the supernatant for each to set is determined with gas chromatography. Plots of concentration vs time for each of the sets are analysed to understand the efficiency of the parts in transporting methylmercury.

        # Characterization of MerA and MerB

        We check for methylmercury concentrations in the presence and absence of MerA and MerB with 3 circuits. The first with presence of both MerA and MerB, the second with deletion of either MerA or MerB respectively and the third with absence of both MerA and MerB. We test to see the increase in the Mer spectrum with the introduction of MerB and MerA to conclude that the addition of the two genes confer to a better resistance to methylmercury. We perform the MTT assay to map the resistance provided by each gene MerA and MerB to show that the introduction of MerB and MerA increases the Mer spectrum, hence implying that the addition of the two genes confers better resistance to methylmercury.
        
        We test the overall working of Bio-Brick 1 to show its efficiency in converting methylmercury to elemental mercury as compared to natural systems.

        # Characterization of SoxR and SoxS

        Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 transformed with SoxR and SoxS genes is tested to analyse the relationship between the amount of oxidative stress and transcription rates of the genes in response to methyl viologen dichloride hydrate which acts as an inducer by measuring GFP intensity. The intensity of GFP increases with time indicating that even if the concentration of the oxidative stress inducer is constant, the rate of activation of SoxR and thus the rate of transcription of SoxS promoter increases and then stabilizes to a constant rate with a higher transcription rate of SoxS promoter with a higher inducer concentration. We test to understand the amount of oxidative stress required to activate SoxR and in turn activate SoxS promoter occurs even at low oxidative stress, preventing any unwanted inflammation due to our probiotic thus getting an anti-inflammatory response activation by composite bio-brick 2. We also check for the basal level of transcription of SoxS promoter so that unwanted anti-inflammatory substances will not be released without the presence of oxidative stress.

        # Efficiency of the Hemolysin Secretion System

        We test for the efficiency of the control system consisting of HlyB, HlyD, TolC and HlyA against a control with HlyB, HlyD and TolC absent. We analyse the HlyA + GFP transported outside the cells, HlyA + GFP remaining inside the cells and the total HlyA + GFP produced with absorbance vs time graphs to show to efficiency in getting the anti-inflammatory cytokines outside the cell to the target site.
        
        Finally, we test the overall working of Bio-Brick 2 to show that it will work only in the conditions of methylmercury induced inflammation.
